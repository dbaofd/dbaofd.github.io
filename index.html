<h3 style="color:red">And the morning that You rose </h3>
<h3 style="color:red">All of Heaven held its breath </h3>
<h3 style="color:red">Till that stone was moved for good </h3>
<h3 style="color:red">For the Lamb had conquered death </h3>
<h3 style="color:red">And the dead rose from their tombs </h3>
<h3 style="color:red">And the angels stood in awe </h3>
<h3 style="color:red">For the souls of all who'd come </h3>
<h3 style="color:red">To the Father are restored </h3>
<h3 style="color:red">And the church of Christ was born </h3>
<h3 style="color:red">Then the Spirit lit the flame </h3>
<h3 style="color:red">Now this gospel truth of old </h3>
<h3 style="color:red">Shall not kneel, shall not faint </h3>

<h3 style="color:red">In His freedom I am free </h3>
